    <h3>What is Dinq?</h3>
    <p>Dinq stands for D InQuizitive(The InQuizitive). It is a Quizzing website completely dedicated to India. As
        viewers and readers of our current News companies, we have always wondered, how are people able to
        consume and understand so much information around them? There are so many 24X7 format of TV
        news channels, newspapers, magazines and online magazines. Moreover, each of the above-mentioned
        entities take a specific political side when it comes to interpreting and presenting the news. In such
        situation, it becomes difficult to learn about and understand the true implication of anything happening
        around us.</p>
        <br>
    <h3>Why we do, what we do?</h3>
    <p>Dinq aims to bring the news of India to the Indians <b>through the medium of a Quiz.</b>
        No more long blog posts and videos of people shouting on one another. 
        We provide a fun and interactive way of learning the current events in India through the press of a button. 
        After every question attempted, we also provide an explanation section, where we try to provide background into the asked question and how the events came around in that context. </p>
    <p>Neither our questions nor our explanations are influenced by political climate in India. We only go by facts and try to present the true events for any category of quiz introduced.</p>
    <p>Dinq also aims at informing people more about glorious stories of such Indians that people may not have heard of or are not fully aware with their stories.
         We believe every Indian story is important, and especially those that have brought a positive impact in our society in any way possible. 
         We want to remember our unsung heroes and put them on the world map.</p>
